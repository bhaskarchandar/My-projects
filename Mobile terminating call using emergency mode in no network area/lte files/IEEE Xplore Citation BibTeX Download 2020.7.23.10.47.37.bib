  abstract={The LTE, as a full-IP based system, accesses to packet data network, which becomes an important means of data transmission. The PDN connectivity procedure is an important process when the LTE communication system accesses to packet data network. The purpose of PDN connectivity procedure is to set up a default EPS bearer between a UE and a packet data network. In this paper, the LTE terminal protocol stack structure is described, the module which the PDN connectivity procedure deals with is find out, and a method related the design and realization of terminal PDN connectivity procedure are put forward. TTCN test tools are applied for tests and simulation of the software related PDN connectivity procedure. Simulation results show that this process in full compliance with the LTE standard, verify the correctness and feasibility of this design.},
